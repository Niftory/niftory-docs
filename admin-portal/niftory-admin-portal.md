# Niftory Admin Portal

The Admin Portal is your developer dashboard to manage your applicationâ€”create NFT models, handle minting, and track analytics as users interact with your NFTs. Create your account at [Niftory.com](https://niftory.com) to get started

### Core Concepts

The Admin Portal is organized around these constructs:

* [**Orgs**](https://docs.niftory.com/docs/v/niftory-admin/explore/org-and-apps): The Org is your home in the Admin Portal. Everything you do in the Admin Portal, including any NFTs you create, gets associated to your Org.
  * Your Org contains your **App**, and is the place to go to manage your API keys.
  * Your Org also lets you manage your **Team**; these are people who also have access to managing your App and NFT collection.
* [**Sets**](https://docs.niftory.com/docs/v/niftory-admin/explore/nft-collection/sets): A Set in Admin represents an [**NFTSet**](https://api-docs-niftory.vercel.app/#definition-NFTSet) in the API. It is a bag of NFT blueprints ([NFTModel](https://api-docs-niftory.vercel.app/#definition-NFTModel)).
* [**Collectibles**](https://docs.niftory.com/docs/v/niftory-admin/explore/nft-collection/collectibles)**:** A Collectible is an [**NFTModel**](https://api-docs-niftory.vercel.app/#definition-NFTModel) in the API.
* [**NFTs**](https://docs.niftory.com/docs/v/niftory-admin/explore/nft-collection/nfts): Once you have created a Set, and a Collectible, you can mint the Collectible into NFTs.
